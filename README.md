# Color-Sorter-Machine-
Using Arduino Uno &amp; C - practical project
Hardware components: Arduino UNO, Servomotor, Color sensor. 
As the name, my project was made to sort different colors in different boxes, the colored pieces which are held in the charger drop into the platform attached on the top servo motor.
Then the servo motor rotates and brings the skittle to the color sensor which detects its color. After that the bottom servo motor rotates to the particular position and then the top servo motor rotates again till the skittle drop into the guide rail. The project can be designed on different levels, encompassing problems of different sizes.
